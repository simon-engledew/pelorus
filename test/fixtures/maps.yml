  description: This map is concerned with improving the call centre, 
    and in particular with improving the customer query process so as to 
    (i) reduce the time and cost needed to handle each customer query and 
    (ii) increase the number of cross-sales of additional products to customers 
    who contact the call centre.
    
    
    These improvements to the customer query
    process are in turn supported by a new customer information computer system 
    that (i) guides the call centre operator through the conversation with the customer; 
    (ii) presents all relevant information about the customer at each stage of the 
    conversation; and (iii) automatically generates and presents suggestions for 
    products that could be cross-sold, together with the selling proposition.
    
    
    The improvements to the query process allow operator staff numbers within 
    the call centre to be reduced and the freed staff to be assigned to other 
    positions within the company. This in turn enables a reduction in call centre 
    costs.
