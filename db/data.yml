    - Within the Call Centre, the Customer Enquiry process will be redesigned, with support from a new CRM system. The new process will be more efficient than its predecessor, provide continuity of customer contacts and support cross-selling. With the efficiency gains, some Call Centre staff will be reassigned to marketing roles. This will lead to substantial cost savings and other business benefits.

      Currently, for historical reasons, we have several small offices in a 30-mile radius of Reading. This has resulted in inefficient use of space. Further, communication and cooperation between departments and individuals is more difficult than it should be.
      
      This change is to relocate all staff into a single new office and close all the old offices.

      Measurement:
      
      During the first week of each calendar month, the customer relations department conducts a telephone survey of a sample of customers who contacted the call centre during the previous month.  One of the standard question concerns the helpfulness of call centre staff, with responses in the range 'very helpful' to 'very unhelpful'.
      
      The customer relations department applies a standard algorithm to convert received responses into a 'helpfulness' percentage ranking, where higher numbers represent a greater degree of helpfulness and 100 is the 'perfect' score.
      
      The value of this factor is the latest helpfulness ranking as reported by the customer relations department.

      Description:
      
      The number of enquiries handled to closure during a peak shift. (Note: The actual number will obviously depend on the number of calls we receive. But with this factor we are aiming to track the capacity of the call centre to handle large numbers of calls.)
      
      Measurement:
      
      The CRM system will report on demand on the number of enquiries closed during any shift. We take the maximum value from any of the last 60 completed shifts.

      Measurement:
      
      The CRM system tracks the number of operators logged on during each shift. We take the number from the shift that handled the peak number of calls during the past month (i.e. the shift that we use for determing the value of the 'Enquiries handled during peak shift' factor).

      The average time taken by a call centre operator to handle an enquiry call from a customer. 
      
      Measurement:
      
      The CRM system maintains records of the time taken to handle each customer enquiry.  On demand, the system produces a standard report on the average time to handle each customer enquiry for any specified calendar month. To measure this factor, obtain this standard report for the last complete calendar month and take the value from the report.  The value is specified in seconds, as required for this measurement.

      Customer ranking of the helpfulness of call centre staff, as established by a regular survey.
      
      Measurement:
      
      During the first week of each calendar month, the customer relations department conducts a telephone survey of a sample of customers who contacted the call centre during the previous month.  One of the standard question concerns the helpfulness of call centre staff, with responses in the range 'very helpful' to 'very unhelpful'.
      
      The customer relations department applies a standard algorithm to convert received responses into a 'helpfulness' percentage ranking, where higher numbers represent a greater degree of helpfulness and 100 is the 'perfect' score.
      
      The value of this factor is the latest helpfulness ranking as reported by the customer relations department.

      At the end of the course, the assessors assign a helpfulness figure to each trainee, based on the trainee's handling of sample enquiries. This figure is a percentage, with 100% representing the highest possible level of helpfulness. The factor is measured by taking the average of all trainees who have completed the course.

      In reducing call centre staff numbers, we are relying primarily on natural wastage -- our historical natural wastage rate has been ~18% per year. For further reductions beyond natural wastage, we are aiming to find staff suitable positions in other parts of the company, primarily in tele-marketing. However, we might not be able to find enough suitable positions.

      Mitigation measures:
      
      1. Negotiate voluntary redundancy packages with staff for whom we can't find positions. Note: this will increase overall costs.

      We are striving particularly for an efficient customer enquiry process, supported by  automated workflows.  Given this stress on automation and efficiency, there is some danger that our customers will regard our call centre staff as 'mechanical' rather than 'helpful'.
      
      Avoidance measures:
      
      1.  The automated workflows in the new customer information system will be specifically designed to promote an overall impression of helpfulness.
      
      2.  Training of call centre staff will emphasise the importance of helpfulness and the need for a friendly and responsive manner.
      
      Mitigation measures:
      
      1.  Adjustment of both the automated workflows and the detailed scripts in the new customer information system, in the light of feedback from both our call centre staff and - especially - our customers.
      
      2.  Further training of call centre staff.
    - Customers may view our staff as efficient rather than helpful

      Our prices will inevitably be higher than supermarkets in Borchester and elsewhere. This could deter shoppers. [Note, however, that we are already assuming that people will do their 'big' shop in Borchester. We aim to provide for the 'fill in' shopping only -- staples that people have run out of, daily bread, newspapers, snacks, and so on.]\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Avoidance measures:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      1. Promote the message about the total cost of shopping. For a shopping basket with a few basic items (say, total cost around \xC2\xA35) compare the total cost in the community shop versus the total cost of driving to Borchester and buying those items in a supermarket (or having the items delivered at a \xC2\xA35 charge).\r\n\
      \r\n\
      2. Promote the more general message about supporting the community shop -- 'use it or lose it'.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Mitigation measures:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      1. Negotiate with suppliers to share the pain of lowering prices. If the shop is forced to close, they will (yet again) lose out to the supermarkets.\r\n"

      1. Highlight local produce in all shop promotional material -- flyers, adverts, signage.
      
      2. Promote local produce within the shop. Use a dedicated area, special campaigns.

      1. Actively search for local suppliers with whom we have previously had no contact who may have produce that would be attractive to our customers.

      Once the initial excitement has worn off, some of our volunteers may decide that they do not want to donate their time.
      
      Avoidance measures:
      
      1. Maintain a pool of volunteers that is more than sufficient for our needs.
      
      2. Ensure that the rota system is highly flexible, so that people can always withdraw from a shift when they want to.
      
      3. Foster an active community of volunteers, with regular meetings and social events.
      
      Mitigation measures:
      
      1. Recruit some paid staff to supplement the volunteers. However, this will have a major (and probably unsustainable) impact on profit margins.
